# Typescript

## task_0

Write your code in the main.ts file:

Write an interface named Student that accepts the following elements: firstName(string), lastName(string), age(number), and location(string)
Create two students, and create an array named studentsList containing the two variables
Using Vanilla Javascript, render a table and for each elements in the array, append a new row to the table
Each row should contain the first name of the student and the location
Requirements:

When running, Webpack should return No type errors found.
Every variable should use TypeScript when possible.

## task_1

Create a directory task_1 and copy these configuration files into this folder: package.json, tsconfig.json, webpack.config.js

firstName(string) and lastName(string). These two attributes should only be modifiable when a Teacher is first initialized
fullTimeEmployee(boolean) this attribute should always be defined
yearsOfExperience(number) this attribute is optional
location(string) this attribute should always be defined
Add the possibility to add any attribute to the Object like contract(boolean) without specifying the name of the attribute
Example:

const teacher3: Teacher = {
  firstName: 'John',
  fullTimeEmployee: false,
  lastName: 'Doe',
  location: 'London',
  contract: false,
};

console.log(teacher3);

// should print
// Object
// contract: false
// firstName: "John"
// fullTimeEmployee: false
// lastName: "Doe"
// location: "London"
